<b><i>Unuploadable because:</i></b>
</p>
<p>
This one should have been uploadable, but it was taking forever to the point where I decided to put it here instead. After that decision, I added the screenshot feature.
</p>
<p>
<b><i>Mario Kart DS Controls and Things You Should Know:</i></b>
</p>
<p>
W for gas, A/D to steer, SPACE to drift.
ENTER to select on the selection screens. SHIFT to take screenshot.
Resolution slider sets resolution of textured tri filler, setting to 0 will make things further out less detailed, but closer things will have high detail.
Wireframe further out will be filled in as you get closer, it was a way to show all of the scene and still have performance.
Note that it was made to run in a laggy environment, so the framerate limit is 15 FPS. Don't be surprised if it is running below 20 FPS.

Transform point, add 3D triangle, set pen color to RGB, calculate distances, and set p to xyz functions are by <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/CodingBio">@CodingBio</a>. 3D projection functions are by <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/finnagin5">@finnagin5</a>. The triangle filler was created by <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/-Rex-Test-">@-Rex-Test-</a> and <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/Geotale">@Geotale</a>  (Solid filler was not used). I looked at <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/CodingBio">@CodingBio</a>'s engine to find how to detect points behind camera. Credit to <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/ggenije">@ggenije</a> for the binary insertion sort. FPS counter inspired by the one in https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/422631818 by <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/Howtomakeausername">@Howtomakeausername.</a> The rotation functions used are by <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/Steelix1000">@Steelix1000.</a> The textured triangle filler is by <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/Vadik1">@Vadik1.</a> <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/KryptoAlt">@KryptoAlt</a> made the STTF filler. (not used)
</p>
<p>
I followed <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/CodingBio">@CodingBio</a>'s tutorial for sorting here.

Big thanks to <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/CodingBio">@CodingBio</a>. <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/CodingBio">@CodingBio</a>'s tutorials on 3D really helped me learn about 3D, as well as looking at the code in the last demo in part 5 of the series (This helped with writing some code).

Backface culling uses matrices as I found here: https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1324179/how-to-tell-if-3-connected-points-are-connected-clockwise-or-counter-clockwise
The culling is run after the triangle is projected to the screen.
